# Project Title:  Data Cleaning Project

## Description
This project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning using Python and pandas. The goal was to clean and preprocess a sales dataset, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types to make it ready for analysis and modeling.

Key steps involved:
- **Data Exploration**: Examining the dataset's structure and understanding its contents.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, fixing inconsistent formatting, and removing duplicates.
- **Data Transformation**: Converting data types and creating new meaningful columns.

## Tools Used

- pandas
- Google Colab
